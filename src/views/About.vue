      <h2>About The QADI App</h2>
      <p>QADI is a way to measure the outcomes of a project or a project sprint. Scores are given for each of <span class="action">Qualitiy</span>, <span class="action">Attitude</span>, <span class="action">Deadline</span> and <span class="action">Innovation</span>.</p>
      <p>Team members can use this app to submit their QADI scores for a project</p>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>Once you've completed your scores you can share them with the team by sending them (or the coordinator) the URL in you browser's URL bar (yes, the whole of that long and ugly looking URL). When they open the link they will have all the scores exactly as you've set them.</p>
